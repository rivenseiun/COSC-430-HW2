Trollz - SawanoHiroyuki[nZk] /Laco

Mirrors
The smoke and mirrors
Hold my trigger
I can smell a troll
Punk a*s
You ain't happy either?
Oily mouse
Rabbity house
Yesterday's old cold pizza
Circle of haters
Shoot the waiter
Was it you?
Down in the basement
Laughing
There's nobody there
Someone is worst
But I don't care
Someone is lost
Alone'n' scared
They'd rather be a pain than no one
Stairs and bridges gonna raise a cathedral with imagination
Off the muscle gonna leave you in pieces when you hear my creation
One hundred times more writing the score
To the core
100 days now lover walked out the door
100 times more
Never
Ever
Going to stop me
Matter
You make dark matter
Ventilator
Watch us lose control
Trap door
Breather
Little teaser
Wanna be great
Hookin' the bait
Eight out of eight
Soul licker
Causin' the chaos
Seeds of doubt
That you sow
Try to defame us
Spout
What you may not know
Something you lost
But I don't care
You can go seivel on your chair
They'd rather be a pain than no one
Stairs and bridges gonna raise a cathedral with imagination
Off the muscle gonna leave you in pieces when you hear my creation
One hundred times more writing the score
To the core
100 days now lover walked out the door
100 times more
Never
Ever
Going to stop me
Stairs and bridges gonna raise a cathedral with imagination
Off the muscle gonna leave you in pieces when you hear my creation
One hundred times more writing the score
To the core
100 days now lover walked out the door
100 times more
Never
Ever
Going to stop me
